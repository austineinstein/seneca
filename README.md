Visualisation of headlines affecting asset prices as our BTC clusters unlike the S2F model:

Each of the four identified BTC clusters has a very different S2F-market value combination that seems to be consistent with halvings and changing BTC narratives.

BTC “Proof of concept” (S2F 1.3 and market value $1M)

BTC “Payments” (S2F 3.3 and market value $58M)

BTC “E-Gold” (S2F 10.2 and market value $5.6B)

BTC “Financial asset” (S2F 25.1 and market value $114B)
